## 🧠 1. Simple Console Application with Different Functions

### **Project Goal**
Create a basic console application that demonstrates various functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) while utilizing variables, data types, and control flow mechanisms (if/else, match).

### **What to Implement**
- Create multiple functions for basic arithmetic operations
- Use different data types (integers, floating-point numbers)
- Implement control flow structures (if/else statements)
- Use match expressions for operation selection
- Handle user input from console
- Display results in formatted output
- Implement error handling for invalid operations (like division by zero)
- Use variables with different scopes and lifetimes

### **What NOT to Implement**
- Complex mathematical calculations beyond basic arithmetic
- GUI interfaces or graphical elements
- External database connections
- Advanced memory management features
- Multi-threading or async operations
- Complex data structures beyond basic types

### **Tools and Technologies**
- Rust compiler (rustc)
- Standard library only (no external crates needed)
- Basic console input/output operations
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Basic control flow statements
