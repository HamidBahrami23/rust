PROJECT NAME: Advanced Rust Pattern Matching System

PROJECT AIM:
Create a comprehensive Rust application that demonstrates advanced match expressions combined with enums, structs, ownership, borrowing, functions, and I/O operations. The system should showcase how to effectively use pattern matching to handle complex data structures and business logic.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

1. CREATE ENUM STRUCTURES:
   - Define ProductType enum with Book, Electronics, Clothing, and Unknown variants
   - Each variant should contain relevant data fields
   - Implement proper data types (String, i32, f64, char)

2. CREATE STRUCTURE DEFINITIONS:
   - Define Customer struct with name, age, and email fields
   - Define ShoppingCartItem struct with product, quantity, and price
   - Define ShoppingCart struct with items, customer, and total_amount

3. IMPLEMENT ADVANCED MATCH EXPRESSIONS:
   - Use pattern matching with enum destructuring
   - Implement binding to extract values from enum variants
   - Use wildcard patterns (_)
   - Apply pattern guards with conditions
   - Demonstrate nested pattern matching

4. DEVELOP FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Create get_customer_info() function using immutable borrowing
   - Implement get_statistics() function using mutable borrowing
   - Build get_summary() function that transfers ownership
   - Add purchase processing logic with complex pattern matching

5. HANDLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
   - Simulate user input scenarios
   - Process different action patterns
   - Display results to console
   - Handle various user conditions

6. STRUCTURE YOUR CODE PROPERLY:
   - Organize functions within the main() scope
   - Use proper ownership transfer concepts
   - Implement borrowing patterns correctly
   - Add comprehensive comments explaining each section

WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO:

1. AVOID SIMPLE MATCHING:
   - Don't use basic pattern matching only
   - Don't implement trivial enum variants
   - Don't create simple functions without advanced concepts

2. DON'T MIX OWNERSHIP ERRORS:
   - Don't try to use moved values after transfer
   - Don't mix mutable and immutable references incorrectly
   - Don't create borrowing conflicts

3. AVOID CODE REDUNDANCY:
   - Don't repeat same pattern matching logic
   - Don't create unnecessary variables
   - Don't overcomplicate simple operations

4. DON'T IGNORE ERROR HANDLING:
   - Don't assume all user inputs will be valid
   - Don't ignore pattern matching edge cases
   - Don't skip proper data validation

5. AVOID PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
   - Don't create unnecessary clones
   - Don't use inefficient loops
   - Don't store data inappropriately

EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
- Complete working Rust project
- Well-commented code explaining each advanced concept
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Clean, organized code structure
- Demonstrated understanding of Rust ownership system
- Comprehensive use of advanced match expressions
